Report: Used Cars Data Analysis
1. Introduction
  This project looks at data from used cars. The idea is to find out what things (like age, mileage, fuel type) make a car more expensive or cheaper.
2. About the Data
  The file is called used_cars_data.csv. It has details of cars such as:
  •	Car name
  •	Year of manufacture
  •	Selling price (how much it is being sold for)
  •	Present price (price if new)
  •	Kilometers driven
  •	Fuel type (Petrol, Diesel, CNG)
  •	Transmission (Manual or Automatic)
  •	Number of owners
3. Goals of the Project
  •	Clean the data so it can be used properly
  •	Study the information to see patterns
  •	Make simple charts to explain the data
  •	Find out what affects car prices the most
  •	Prepare for building a model that can predict prices
4. What We Found
  Cleaning
  •	Removed errors or missing values
  •	Changed year into “car age” for easier study
            Budget Cars (Selling Price < 10 Lakhs)
            Overview
            Budget cars are the majority in the dataset. These cars are affordable and are usually older models with higher kilometers driven.
            Key Points
            •	Fuel Type: Most budget cars use Petrol. Diesel is less common, CNG is very rare.
            •	Transmission: Almost all are Manual. Only a few are Automatic.
            •	Age: Many budget cars are older (more than 5 years).
            •	Kilometers Driven: Budget cars usually have higher mileage.
            •	Price Trend: Selling price drops quickly with age and kilometers.
            Insights
            •	Budget cars are best for buyers looking for affordable options.
            •	Petrol cars dominate this segment.
            •	Older cars lose value fast, which makes them cheaper for second-hand buyers.
            Luxury Cars (Selling Price ≥ 10 Lakhs)
            Overview
            Luxury cars form a smaller part of the dataset. These cars are high-end, newer models, often with more features.
            Key Points
            •	Fuel Type: Diesel is common among luxury cars, but Petrol is also significant.
            •	Transmission: Many luxury cars are Automatic, unlike budget cars.
            •	Age: Most luxury cars are newer (less than 5 years old).
            •	Kilometers Driven: Luxury cars usually have lower mileage.
            •	Price Trend: Prices remain high for the first few years and drop slower compared to budget cars.
            Insights
            •	Automatic transmission is much more common in luxury cars.
            •	Diesel cars dominate the luxury market because they are fuel-efficient for long drives.
            •	Luxury cars keep their value longer compared to budget cars.
5. Tools Used
  •	Python programming
  •	Pandas and NumPy (for handling data)
  •	Matplotlib and Seaborn (for charts)
  •	Jupyter Notebook (to do the work step by step)
6. Next Steps
  •	Make a computer model that can guess the price of a car
  •	Build a simple dashboard to explore the data
  •	Add more car details to get better results
7. Conclusion
  Car price mainly depends on age, mileage, fuel type, and transmission.
  This project helps understand the used car market and can be used later to build a price prediction tool.
